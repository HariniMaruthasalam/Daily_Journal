# What is Daily Journal??
A daily journal, also known as a diary or journaling, is a personal writing practice where individuals record their thoughts, experiences, and reflections on a regular basis. It serves as a tool for self-expression, self-reflection, and personal growth. Writing in a journal can be done in various formats, including handwritten entries in a physical notebook or using digital platforms or apps.

Keeping a daily journal can have numerous benefits for individuals:

1. Self-reflection and self-awareness: Journaling allows individuals to explore their thoughts, emotions, and experiences in a private and non-judgmental space. It promotes self-reflection and helps develop self-awareness, enabling individuals to gain insights into their beliefs, values, and personal growth.

2. Emotional well-being: Writing in a journal can be a therapeutic practice that helps individuals process and manage their emotions. It provides an outlet for expressing feelings, reducing stress, and improving overall emotional well-being. Journaling can serve as a form of self-care and a means to cope with challenging situations.

3. Memory preservation: By recording daily events, experiences, and milestones, a journal becomes a repository of memories. It allows individuals to capture important moments, lessons learned, and personal achievements, creating a lasting record of their lives.

4. Goal setting and progress tracking: Journaling can support goal setting and tracking progress towards personal or professional aspirations. By writing down goals, plans, and action steps, individuals can clarify their objectives and monitor their achievements over time. Journaling provides an opportunity to evaluate progress, adjust strategies, and celebrate successes.

5. Creativity and self-expression: Journaling encourages creative thinking and self-expression. It provides a space for individuals to explore their ideas, dreams, and imagination. Through writing, drawing, or incorporating other artistic elements, individuals can unleash their creativity and tap into their unique perspectives.

6. Problem-solving and decision-making: Writing in a journal can facilitate problem-solving and decision-making processes. By organizing thoughts on paper, individuals can gain clarity, identify patterns, and generate new insights. Journaling can help analyze situations from different angles, weigh pros and cons, and make informed choices.

7. Personal development and growth: Consistent journaling fosters personal development and growth. It encourages individuals to set intentions, reflect on their values, and align their actions with their aspirations. Journaling can help identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, supporting individuals' continuous learning and self-improvement journey.

Ultimately, the practice of daily journaling is highly personal, and individuals can tailor it to their preferences and needs. Whether used as a private space for self-reflection or a tool for creative expression, a daily journal can serve as a valuable companion on one's personal growth and self-discovery path.

# About the Project

The app is built using CSS, and Node.js with the EJS templating engine. Its primary objective is to provide an end user with a user-friendly platform for creating and saving their daily journal entries.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code. It is used in this app to handle server-side operations, such as handling HTTP requests, routing, and interacting with a database.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine for Node.js that simplifies the generation of HTML content dynamically. It enables the app to dynamically generate journal entry pages based on user input. EJS combines HTML markup with JavaScript logic to dynamically render and display data on the web pages.

The app's main functionality revolves around allowing users to create and save their daily journal entries. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter the title, date, and content of their journal entry. The app then processes and stores this data, allowing users to access and manage their journal entries at any time.

Additionally, the app may include features such as authentication to ensure that each user's journal entries are private and secure. It might also incorporate the ability to edit or delete existing journal entries, search for specific entries, add tags or categories to entries for organization, and provide a visually appealing and responsive design for optimal user experience across different devices.

Overall, the app's aim is to provide a convenient and accessible platform for users to create, store, and manage their daily journal entries in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.
